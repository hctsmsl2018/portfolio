                Hi! I am a curious and diligent senior at Dublin High School's Engineering Academy. After I graduate, I want to find a job in the field of engineering or computer science. To achieve this goal, I am taking challenging science, engineering, and mathematics courses, and I am working toward a major in computer science.
                <br>
                <br>
                My passion for technology and its development makes me interested in engineering. For instance, I love exploring new products from companies like Google and Apple. I enjoy using many of their products, such as the iPhone and Google Drive. I admire their cutting-edge technology and quick innovations.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of my biggest accomplishments in high school is learning about engineering as both a discipline and a potential career. In addition to becoming competent with Python and Java, I have also had hands-on learning experiences and projects in mechanical and electrical engineering in high school engineering classes. For example, I have worked with peers to create a Python version of Hangman, an educational game in Java, a mechanical winch, and solar and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Furthermore, I explored careers in engineering by listening to guest speakers who specialize in various fields from artificial intelligence to civil engineering. In addition to attending guest talks, I participated in both in-person and virtual field trips to immerse myself in both careers and research related to engineering. I have seen the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory with my own eyes and listened to professionals who have worked at companies such as Microsoft and Amazon. I have greatly enjoyed learning about different forms of engineering and engineering careers with my teachers and industry professionals.
                <br>
                <br>
                Experiences outside of the Engineering Academy have also enhanced my knowledge of engineering. During freshman year, I was in the academy of the Gael Force Robotics club, where I learned about robot design and mechanical engineering and built a VEX competition robot prototype with other students. In the summer after junior year, I participated in UC Santa Barbara's Summer Research Academies program, where I learned about machine learning and developed neural networks. With a team, I completed a research project utilizing neural networks to determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. In this project, we concluded that COVID-19 vaccines were effective, and the application of neural networks helped broaden our knowledge of computer science and software engineering.
                <br>
                <br>
                Through experiences inside and outside of the Engineering Academy, I discovered my strong interest in technology, and hope to pursue a career in this area.
