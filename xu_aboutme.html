                Hi!
                I am 14 years old and a curious and diligent freshman at Dublin High School. 
                When I grow up, I want to find a job in the field of engineering. 
                To achieve this goal, I will take more classes in subjects like computer science, engineering, and science in school, and work toward a major in related fields as well. 
                I choose fields in engineering and technology as what my career is going to be focused on, because I have an interest in subjects like technology. 
                Also, I have chosen my career based off of my strong academic areas, like math.
                <br>
                <br>
                One quality I have which made me interested in the engineering field is my open-mindedness and interest on the topic. 
                I am also interested in the advancement of technology. 
                For instance, I sometimes look up the details of some of the new products of major tech companies, like Apple. 
                I also get fascinated and amazed in the abilities of the features of products of Google. 
                The features of Google are interesting due to the extensive abilities of their services.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of my accomplishments in high school is learning my first programming languages. 
                Some of them include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), so that I can create some of my first websites like this one here. 
                In middle school, I was able to achieve a 4.0 grade point average for all 3 years. 
                That made me know that I am one of the most diligent and self-motivated students in my grade, considering the amount of other students who had made that achievement. 
                That accomplishment also inspired me to aim high in my studies and future work.
                <br>
                <br>
                In summary, I am a successful student with strong interests in the field of technology. 
                I thank you for reading this page, and I recommend that you check out other areas of this page, using the links at the top.
