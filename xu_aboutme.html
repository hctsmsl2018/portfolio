                Hi!
                I am 15 years old and a curious and diligent freshman at Dublin High School. 
                When I grow up, I want to find a job in the field of engineering or computer science. 
                To achieve this goal, I will take more classes in subjects like computer science, engineering, and science in school, and work toward a major in related fields as well. 
                I choose fields in engineering and technology as what my career is going to be focused on, because I have an interest in subjects like technology. 
                Also, I have chosen my career based off of my strong academic areas, like math.
                <br>
                <br>
                One quality I have which made me interested in the engineering field is my open-mindedness and interest on the topic. 
                I am also interested in the advancement of technology. 
                For instance, I sometimes look up the details of some of the new products of major tech companies, like Apple. 
                I also get fascinated and amazed in the abilities of the features of products of Google. 
                The features of Google are interesting due to the extensive abilities of their services.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of my accomplishments so far in high school is learning my first programming languages. 
                Some of them include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Python, and Javascript so that I can create some of my first websites like this one here.
                In high school, I was also in the school robotics team, such that I can learn more in the field of robotics and engineering, and experience building a robot with other students.
                In middle school, I was able to achieve a 4.0 grade point average for all 3 years. 
                That made me know that I am one of the most diligent and self-motivated students in my grade, considering the amount of other students who had made that achievement. 
                That accomplishment also inspired me to aim high in my studies and future work.
                <br>
                <br>
                In summary, I am a successful student with strong interests in the field of technology. 
                I thank you for reading this page, and I recommend that you check out other areas of this page, using the links at the top of the page.
