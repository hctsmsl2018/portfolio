                <h3>App Inventor Project</h3>
                <p class="p-2 bd-highlight small">
                    In this project, a partner and I tried to make an app with MIT's 
                    <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/index-2.html" target="_blank">AppInventor</a>
                    . I had the account which stored our app, and most of my work is focused on programming. 
                    While making the app, we kept a formal project notebook, to document ideas and feedback. 
                    We both tried to participate equally in our amounts of work, as our teacher is strict on how much of the work each of us do. 
                    In this project, some of the hardships that we ran into were when we tried to create a timer with the game that we created with the AppInventor code. 
                    In this project, I learned that coding is a type of skill that involves trial and error and can sometimes cause lots of inconvinience. 
                    As a team, we learned how to pair program, share and get feedback from other students in the room, who represent other programmers. 
                    We learned that commenting and organization in the code structure is very important.
