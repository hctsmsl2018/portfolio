                    In this project, a partner and I used MIT's 
                    <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/index-2.html" target="_blank">AppInventor</a>
                    to create an Android app.
                    My account stored our app, and most of my work was focused on programming. 
                    While developing the app, we kept a formal project notebook to document ideas and feedback. 
                    We both participated equally in the work, as our teacher was strict on how much of the work each of us does. 
                    During the project, some of the hardships that we ran into were when we tried to create a timer in the game. 
                    We discussed this problem for a long time, and eventually solved it by adding another timer in the program for the visible timer in the game.
                    In this project, I learned that coding is a type of skill that involves trial and error and may sometimes create challenges. 
                    As a team, we learned how to pair program, share and get feedback from other students in my class, who represent other programmers. 
                    We learned that commenting and organization in the code structure is very important.

                    In this project, a partner and I used the Python image manipulation modules PIL, numpy, and matplotlib to edit images which meet a goal.
                    Also, we documented our work, partly by explaining our changes to each image and making an activity log.
                    When we worked, I focused on the coding, while my partner focused on the project documentation.
                    In this project, I learned specific ways that you can use RGB to change parts of an image, as well as more aspects of the modules we used.
                    We also found that image manipulation is rigorous for both the programmer and the computer, as both need time to do their tasks.
                    Thus, programmers need patience during image manipulation, as waiting for code to run and troubleshooting both take time.
                    One of the challenges we had to solve was finding algorithms to change the color of a part of an image.
                    Also, we had to patch parts of an image that were accidentally changed by other manipulations.
                    While working as a team, we decided everyone's tasks and sometimes problem-solved as a pair.
