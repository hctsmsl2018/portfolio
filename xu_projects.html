                    For this project, I analyzed the outputs of various parts of a random number generator circuit and combined them in the Multisim circuit design software individually. The random number generator outputs a random number from 1 to 6, which are shown with arrangements of dots identical to those found on a 6-sided die. I learned how the timers in a circuit can aid the generation of random numbers and how a circuit signal with a high frequency and a switch can be used to generate random numbers, and how combinational and sequential components of circuits can be combined with each other. One of the challenges I faced in this project was troubleshooting the circuit such that it can produce the correct output. Through comparing my circuit with the circuit diagram provided by my teacher, I was able to find the mistakes in my circuit and fix them so that it will produce the correct output. Another challenge was figuring out where to put a switch so that the circuit will stop running at a random number. I was able to determine that the switch needs to be placed between the clock and the sequential logic part of the circuit, as toggling it will disconnect or connect the signal from the clock, which governs whether the circuit is stopped at a certain value or still running.

                    In this project, I first analyzed a binary counter circuit and then designed a binary counter circuit physically from a circuit diagram individually. First, I analyzed the circuit’s output pattern, period, and frequency of the outputs, which reflect the binary nature of the circuit’s output. After analyzing the circuit on the Multisim circuit design software, I created the circuit on a breadboard and created a recording of its output. During this project, I learned how to make a circuit’s output clearer by slowing down the frequency at which it counts at and constructing complex circuits from diagrams or instructions. I also learned how binary can be used to create counters that only involve lights which can be either on or off. The primary challenge I faced in this project was trying to recreate the circuit from the circuit diagram and getting it to work. I overcame this challenge by utilizing an instructional video to create a part of the circuit created by my teacher along with diagrams of the final circuit. To troubleshoot the circuit after I finished it, I double checked the circuit with the circuit diagrams and the teacher’s directions. After I finished my circuit, I also helped four other classmates troubleshoot their circuits and successfully fix them based on photos of the final circuit and the teacher’s video.

                    In this project, we were required to create a chatbot that accepts user input in Java and document various steps of our design process, such as brainstorming, designing the solution, and evaluating the solution. I was responsible for coding the chatbot and designing the program from beginning to end. I learned how to design and code certain features of a basic AI program, such as generating responses based on user input. I also learned about how I can use methods to simplify Java code in a class that can be run by the main method, as I created many methods in the code for the chatbot to create different features in it. I also learned about the basic structure of a chatbot program, and how it should be programmed to take user input and create an output. A challenge I faced was trying to implement the ability of the chatbot to create a response based on user input. I solved this problem by using randomization so that the chatbot can randomize the output it produces and detect certain words in the input for the chatbot can create a response with. Another challenge I encountered was organizing the code. As I wrote the program, I thought of certain functions for the code to perform and put them into certain methods to help simplify the code. Even though my partner for this project was involved in the design process to a lesser extent than I was, we had more equal parts when presenting the project. As I was more familiar with the chatbot's code, I presented the chatbot code, and as my partner can easily reference the documentation for the design process and prepare to present it, he was able to present parts of the design process in greater detail.

                    The objective of this project was to create an educational game from scratch or from an existing game using the Java programming language. My role in this project was to create questions about the Python programming language the game will ask the player when he or she dies in the game. I also created the functionality in the game that selects a question the player needs to answer, along with the question's respective answer choices and correct answer. Also, I described some of the code for the game in the project's documentation and explained the implementation for asking and responding to the questions in the game in a video presentation. In this project, I learned how some programming tasks might not look easy at first, and sometimes you need to think before programming. Also, I learned about how a Java application can have its code saved in different files and how these files can be linked with each other. A challenge in this project I overcame was deciding how I will store the questions and answers into the application for the game and how I will randomly select them. I overcame this challenge by using arrays to store the strings that represent the questions and their respective answers and using the Math.random() method and mathematical operations to generate random numbers to select a random question. In this project, the teamwork skills of assigning tasks to teammates and deciding the deadlines for tasks are exemplified. This is because this project involves significant amounts of work that should be divided equally among teammates. Furthermore, the completion of certain tasks in this project is also dependent on the completion of preceding tasks, meaning that deadlines should be set and adhered to for each task.

                    For this project, I worked with a partner to design a number riddle program in Java that performs several operations on a number that always gives the result of 3. Also, the program needed to include certain test cases that are used to perform the operations to make sure that the program works as intended. My specific role in the project was to individually develop a version of the program that was to be compared with my partner's version of the same program. When my partner's program and my own were compared, we chose the better program out of the two we created to submit as our final product. In this project, I learned that it is a good practice to estimate the amount of time spent on the development of a certain part of a program and use that estimate as a goal for development, and log the estimated and actual development times for parts of the program on a milestone chart. Furthermore, I learned that the development of a program can often take longer than expected, and troubleshooting can take up a significant amount of time used for development. One of the challenges I overcame during this project is to find and fix errors I made when writing the program. A few minutes after I realized I made the error, I found and fixed it, which led my program to work normally again. Another challenge was identifying the tasks I want to list on the milestone chart and deciding what these tasks were. I was able to overcome this challenge by understanding the requirements of the program I needed to create and figure out how to translate them into different tasks. After my partner and I finalized our program, we presented it to another pair of students who evaluated how well our code works and if it produces the intended results, and my partner and I evaluated their code. This represents the teamwork skill of receiving feedback from others so that the product can be improved.

                    In this project, I designed an insulation material with a team of three other students. The insulation material had to be made out of completely renewable and biodegradable materials, such as wood, paper, and clay. We researched each material we used to better understand certain factors affecting their usefulness, such as its environmental impact and cost-effectiveness. On our project documentation, we described each material based on our research. One of my main roles in the project was to contribute a layer of magazine paper to our insulation material. For the magazine paper, I took several old magazines and cut them to a size that corresponds with that of other parts of our insulation. I then added a clay border around the sheets of magazine paper used for the insulation, so that the magazine paper stays together. Another major contribution I made in this project was performing calculations for values that describe the insulator's effectiveness. For example, using experimental data gathered when testing the insulator, I calculated the thermal conductivity constant, U-value, and R-value for my insulator. When I showed my calculations for my group to check, I made sure to see if everyone agreed and solve disputes if necessary. Even though everyone else agreed with another teammate's work, I found an error and was able to work with my team to correct it. One of my challenges during this project was being neat and exact in my cutting of the magazine paper. When I tried cutting the magazine paper using a paper cutter, the paper cutter sometimes displaced the paper rather than cutting through it, even though I tried to cut fewer sheets of paper at a time. Still, to preserve the exactness of my cutting of the paper, I made shorter cuts at a time to better preserve the exactness. Whenever the paper cutter can not cut through the paper without displacing it, I used a pocket knife to cut the paper to prevent displacing it.

                    For this project, three other students and I worked on a physical model of a mechanical winch and a program using
                    <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/" target="_blank">NetLogo</a>
                    that models it in terms of the behavior of the real-life winch. Also, a documentation describing the winch and program's functionality and development were required. The physical winch needs to have the ability to lift a mass of 100 grams for 30 centimeters. It also needs to be made of only VEX of FischerTech parts, and be powered by a FischerTech motor. The simulation of the winch must show how the size of the surface the rope of the winch coils around and the voltage and current of the electrical power of the winch affects the rate and angular speed at which the cable of the winch coils. During this project, I mainly worked on the program that simulates the behavior of the winch, while I also worked a little bit on the physical prototype of the winch. I worked on all parts of the simulations, such as all of the variables affecting the speed at which the winch works on and the background for the winch model in the simulation. On the project documentation, I included pictures of the code and interface for the program. I also made sure the project documentation is neat and consistent after everyone finished their parts.

                    In this project, a partner and I used the Python image manipulation modules PIL, numpy, and matplotlib to edit images which meet a goal. Also, we documented our work, partly by explaining our changes to each image and creating an activity log. When we worked, I focused on the coding, while my partner focused on the project documentation. In this project, I learned specific ways that you can use RGB to change parts of an image, as well as more aspects of the modules we used. We also found that image manipulation is rigorous for both the programmer and the computer, as both need time to do their tasks. Thus, programmers need patience during image manipulation, as waiting for code to run and troubleshooting both take time. One of the challenges we had to solve was finding algorithms to change the color of a part of an image. Also, we had to patch parts of an image that were accidentally changed by other manipulations. While working as a team, we split up our tasks and sometimes problem-solved as a pair.

                    to create an Android app. My account stored our app, and most of my work was focused on programming. While developing the app, we kept a formal project notebook to document ideas and feedback. We both participated equally in the work. During the project, some of the hardships that we ran into were when we tried to create a timer in the game. We discussed this problem for a long time, and eventually solved it by adding another timer in the program for the visible timer in the game. In this project, I learned that coding is a type of skill that involves trial and error and can be sometimes challenging. As a team, we learned how to pair program, share and get feedback from other students in my class, who represent other programmers. We also learned that commenting and organization in the code structure is very important.
