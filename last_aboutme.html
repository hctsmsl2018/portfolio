            <p class="p-2 bd-highlight small">I am a successful and diligent student at Dublin High School. When I grow up, I want to find a job in a field like engineering or development. To achieve this goal, I will take classes in subjects like develop, engineering, and science in school, and also have a major in that field as well. I choose fields in engineering and technology as what my career is going to be about, because I have an interest in subjects like technology. Also, I have chose my career based off of my strong academic areas, like math.<br><br>One quality I have which make me into the engineering field is my open-mindedness on the topic. I am also interested in the advancement of technology. For instance, I sometimes check the details of some of the new products of important tech companies, like Apple. I also sometimes get interested and amazed in the abilities of the features of products of Google. The features of Google are interesting due to the extensive abilities of their services.<br><br>One of my accomplishments in high school is learning my first programming languages. Some of them include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), such I can make some of my first websites like this one here. In middle school, I was able to achieve a 4.0 grade point average for all 3 years. That led me to know that I am one of the most diligent and self-motivated students in my grade, considering how many other students had made that achievement. That accomplishment also made me feel to have the higher potential to become successful in life.<br><br>In summary, I am a successful student with much interest directed toward the field of technology.
