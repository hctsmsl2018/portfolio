            <h3 class="text-info">My Experiances in the Engineering Academy:</h3>
            <p class="p-2 bd-highlight medium">
              During my time in the engineering program, I have met several industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers.
              When I met them, I learned many aspects of the field of engineering they work in, including the field itself, the work they do, and how they do their work.
              As I met more and more professionals, I gained more knowledge about the various careers in engineering and how it feels like to work as an engineer.
            </p>
            <p class="p-2 bd-highlight medium">
              At one point during my time in the engineering academy, I went on a field trip to the Pleasonton, CA office for Roche Molecular Systems with other engineering students. 
              During the field trip, we explored the various forms of technology used by the company used to conduct research and experiments. 
              One instrument that impressed me was the DNA amplifier. 
              The sizes of the DNA amplifiers shown to us ranged from a size larger than a refrigerator to a size nearly that of a pencil box! 
              At Roche, I also met many of the workers at the company. 
              One of the workers who I met, Lisa Lee Pate, works in the clinical field and creates tests for diseases, and taught us about disease tests and the process of making them. 
              We also met a marketer at Roche, Patrice Riley, who told us her story about choosing a career. 
              Instead of a scientific field, Riley chose English as her college major, and originally wanted to work as a teacher.

            <p class="p-2 bd-highlight medium">
              Another interesting experience as a member of the engineering academy was learning about artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning during a class presentation by a guest speaker, Jason Yosinski. 
              He explained how engineers tried to make AI for the past few decades, while only the AI from the best decade worked well. 
              From his discussion of machine learning, I learned more about how machine learning works, which partly relies on a program changing its own parameters. 
              Yosinski also showed me and my class a program that identifies images of a school bus, which he also explained to us. 
              He said that one of the ways his image identifier works is by taking images of parts of a school bus and having the program to reference these images as guides on what should and should not look like a school bus. 
              Even though I already have an interest in AI and computer programming, he interested me more in computer science by deepening my knowledge of the possibilities of what computers can do.
              For more information on Yosinski, you can find his website
